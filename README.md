# Self-Driving Car Project

Welcome to the Self-Driving Car Project repository! This project aims to develop a self-driving car system using the Udacity dataset and an open-source simulator. This project is part of my internship at CodeClause as AI Intern. The system utilizes the angle of the steering wheel and data from the center camera for autonomous driving.

## Features

- Autonomous Driving: The project implements a self-driving car system capable of navigating through different scenarios using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

- Steering Wheel Angle: The angle of the steering wheel is used as an essential input for controlling the vehicle's direction. This information is crucial for ensuring accurate and safe navigation.

- Camera Data: The project leverages data from the center camera to analyze the environment and make real-time driving decisions. The camera captures visual input, allowing the car to perceive its surroundings.

- Open-Source Simulator: The project uses an open-source simulator to test the self-driving car system. The simulator provides a virtual environment for the car to navigate automatically.
